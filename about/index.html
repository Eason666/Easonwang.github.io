        	    <p>I'm what's called a 'Graduate Developer' at the BBC, on their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/technology/digital-media-graduate-scheme">Software Engineering Graduate Scheme</a>. I'm based in <a href="http://mediacityuk.co.uk/">MediaCityUK</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester">Manchester</a> and live in the area, but I'm originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester">Chester</a>. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/">Aberystwyth University</a> studying <a href="https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/">Computer Science</a>.</p>

		<p>My main fields of interest are Web standards, Web applications, server-side development, user experience, front-end development and Disney Parks! I've been using the <a href="https://www.webplatform.org/">Open Web Platform</a> since the age of 10; back when 2004 when it wasn't so open! I love the change and the silliness of Web standards at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> as they are developed.</p>

		<p>I contribute frequently to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I run nightly builds of Firefox and report bugs and contribute feedback in discussions for new features. Occasionally, I'll also contribute to discussions at the W3C, such as when I proposed a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=17842"><code>defer</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> element</a>, which was considered for standardisation by the Web Performance Working Group in the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html">Resource Priorities specification</a>. (But it never happened. The standards process takes time, and the Web moved on.)</p>

		<p>I'm also a Christian, and a member of <a href="http://www.ubc.org.uk/">Upton Baptist Church</a>.</p>
